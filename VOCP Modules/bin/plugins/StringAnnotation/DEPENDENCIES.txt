This includes the VirtualDocuments JAR file in order to make 
the indirect gazetteer work. If the VirtualDocuments plugin changes,
the JAR from there should probably get copied to here too.
With the new GATE classloader scheme it should be possible to 
use different versions of the VirtualDocuments JAR here and for
the VirtualDocuments plugin.
