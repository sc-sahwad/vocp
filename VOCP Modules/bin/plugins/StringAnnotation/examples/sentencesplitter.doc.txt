This is a test document for checking the sentence splitter rules. Does this work?
Some text before a double new line

Some more text? And exclamation marks!!! And even more marks!!!!!!! which should not split!
Mrs. Smith should not be split either, does it work? And orf.at or gate.ac.uk should not be split
also not 122.123.134.145 or java.util.Class. Does that all work?
